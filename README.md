# SolitaireStation

This repository is so anyone can contribute to SolitaireStation v2

I am terrible with decals and disposals, so I needed a way to get other people to do it for me. If you wish to help contribute to this project, the 'Projects' tab will actively be maintained until the project as a whole is either completed or abandoned.

- If you need any help Contributing, or made a Pull Request, please ping or directly message me over Discord ( @John Willard#6211 )
- There's also good toolings linked in the pinned messages of #ask-contributors over in the Fulpstation discord at https://discord.com/invite/fulpstation

As of March 06 2022, Solitairestation has been removed from the Fulpstation repository. This is the only place Solitairestation can be found, though we have plans to re-add it once this project is complete.

## How to run

This is done with the assumption you are working on this through https://github.com/fulpstation/fulpstation

Once downloaded;
- Put the solitarestation folder in '/maps/map_files/'
- Put solitairestation.json in '/maps/'
- Put modular_pieces.dm file in 'fulp_modules\mapping\helpers\' - Make sure you also put it in tgstation.dme!
- Put solitairestation.toml file in 'fulp_modules\strings\modular_maps\'
- You may have to go in your config and add Solitairestation in your own rotation, before compiling
